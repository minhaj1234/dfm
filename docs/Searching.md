# Searching

Currently, diagramming elements is the only group that is setup to search correctly with pagination

Diagrams, Organizations, Decisions, and KnowledgeSources needed to be moved over to the new search URLs once they come out. As they are currently implemented, search results are not paginated. Once those routes are live, we can implement the search as it is implemented in DiagrammingElements
